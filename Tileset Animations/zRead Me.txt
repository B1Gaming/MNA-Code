First, you should read this thread to understand a bit about tileset animation stuff
https://horizonwii.github.io/horizonwii.net/index9053.html?page=thread&id=196

Open Pa0_jyotyu.arc and extract block_anime.bin. Open the bin in a hex editor.
Insert the brick block header below at the beginning of the file. Then save and close.
00 20 AF 30 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 14
00 00 00 00 00 80 00 20 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 40
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Rename it to "block_anime.tpl" and open it in Brawlbox. Export the image, and edit it

Dimensions of the images used in tile animations are 32 by 32(x)
x represents the number of frames in the tile animation
If there are 4 frames in the animation, then the dimensions of the image would be 32x128.

Also, the box of each animation frame is 32x32. But only the center of the box
is read by the game. The center is 24x24.

Once your done with the tileset animation, replace the image of block_anime.tpl and save.
Drag the tpl on tplrem.py to remove the header.
Rename the tpl to "Anything_That's_Not_In_AnimTiles".bin
(For example, danster_anim.bin)

Now open your custom tileset in SZS Explorer.
Add the bin file in the "BG_tex" folder. Save and quit.

These are some tpl headers you can use for some stuff:

Brick Block header (4 images, 32x128)
00 20 AF 30 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 14
00 00 00 00 00 80 00 20 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 40
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Question Block header (16 images, 32x512)
00 20 AF 30 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 14
00 00 00 00 02 00 00 20 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 40
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Coin Outline header (8 images, 32x256)
00 20 AF 30 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 14
00 00 00 00 01 00 00 20 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 40
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Okay, open the animtiles.txt
Copy the example below, paste it at the end of the txt file, and edit it:
------------------------
texname = REEEE.bin
framedelays = 4, 4, 4, 4
tilenum = 0x123
tileset = 0

end tile
------------------------

texname: The name of the bin file.

framedelays: The number of frame delay between each... frame.

tilenum: The tileset number, the row of the tile, and the column of the tile.
In the example, 0x123 means [Pa0; row 3; column 4]
It's a Pa0 tileset

By the way, each tileset has 16 rows (0-F) and 16 columns (0-F)
This is how tilenum works in Hex, anyways.

tileset: The Pa slot the tileset is part of. (Pa0 = 0, Pa1 = 1, etc)

The maximum amount of frames an animation can take it 255 or 256.


When you're done, save, and use the "txt to bin" bat file
Alright that's it

=====================================
Tileset Animation misc info/gibberish
=====================================
60 frames is probably 1 second
When doing tilenum in hexadecimal, make sure to add 0x to begin it
You can also use integers, but, like, don't

(According to CLF78 and Zementblock) Here are some animation values:
Brick Blocks = 50, 6, 6, 6
Question Blocks = 3 framedelays each

tileset = 1 is equivalent to Pa1

tilenum = 0x234        [tileset 2; row 3; column 4]
tilenum = location on tileset
0x100 = Row 0, Column 0
0x101 = Row 0, Columnn 1
0x110 = Row 1, Column 0
0x111 = Row 1, Column 1
etc
